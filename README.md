In this Project the objective is to analyze patient health and demographic data collected during the vaccination campaign to gain insights into the factors contributing to low vaccination rates within this specific group. By identifying these factors, I can develop effective strategies to address them and ultimately increase the vaccination rate among the target population for better health and lifestyle.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING.


Flu (influenza) is a common viral infection that attacks the nose, throat and lungs.Young children, Older adults, Pregnant women and people with Chronic disease
or weak immune system are at high risk.Flu sometimes can be deadly,especially in high risk groups.By conducting this analysis I aim to look for factors that affect many people not to be vaccinated.

I am therefore conducting analysis with the aim of enabling more disadvantaged people to get vaccinated against the virus for it has many strains.

MODELLING.
I conducted modelling using four machine learning models:


Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier.

K-Nearest Neighbors.

Gradient Boosting Classifier.


MODELLING RESULTS.


Achieving accuracy of 80% and Specificity of 83% I chose the Random Forest Classifier as my model.
Because this meant my model had 8/10 chances of identifying the negative values which were the main priority of the study.


CONCLUSION.


The ML models developed for predicting vaccine non-uptake showed promising results, with a moderate accuracy of 78%, correctly identifying a substantial number of individuals who did not receive the seasonal flu vaccine. The models also highlighted several features that significantly influenced the likelihood of not receiving the vaccine namely:


i)opinion_seas_risk


ii)opinion_seas_vacc_effective,


iii)doctor_recc_seasonal, 


iv)opinion_h1n1_risk, 


v)opinion_h1n1_vacc_effective.
